G: ask nationwide to help me buy my first home. 

A: Hello Nationwide Hackathon. I am home advisor. Buying a home is the biggest and most complex purchase most people will make. Fortunately I work with a great team of financial advisors and we can develop a personalized plan to help buy your first home. To get started, tell me about the home you are looking for. What zip code do you want to live in?

G: I am looking for a two bedroom townhouse in nine four three zero one. 

A: Looking at the prices on Zillow for two bedroom townhouses in Palo Alto, the average price is 500,000 dollars. Do you know how much you want to put for a down payment?

G: How much do you recommend?

A: We recommend a 20% downpayment on your first home purchase, and keeping an additional 5% of funds in reserve for closing costs and unexpected expenses. Can I access your bank account to design your savings plan?

G: Sure go ahead. 

A: Accessing now. It looks like you have 50,000 dollars in your savings account. How much of this would you like to use towards the downpayment?

G: All of it

A: Okay, 50,000 dollars is 40% of the 125,000 dollars we reccomend saving. Your savings has been growing at 4,000 dollars per month over the last year. If you continue saving at this rate, you will have saved enough for your downpayment in 19 months. 

G: How long would it take if I only saved 3,500 per month?

A: It will take 21 months to save your down payment. 

G: Let's plan for 4,000 a month. 

A: Sounds like a good plan. You can ask me about your saving progress at any time, and we can update your plan if anything changes. Let's move onto your mortgage payments. With your credit score and current rates, I expect you will pay five percent interest.

G: What is my monthly payment on a seventy five thousand dollar mortgage with a five percent interest rate and a thirty year term?

A: ...

G: What about a 15 year term?
