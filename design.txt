G: ask nationwide to help me buy my first home. 

A: Hello Nationwide Hackathon. I am home advisor. Buying a home is the biggest and most complex purchase most people will make. Fortunately I work with a great team of financial advisors and we can develop a personalized plan to help buy your first home. To get started, tell me about the home you are looking for.

G: I am looking for a two bedroom townhouse in Palo Alto. 

A: Looking at the prices on Zillow for two bedroom townhouses in Palo Alto, the average price is 500,000 dollars. Do you know how much you want to put for a down payment?

G: How much do you recommend?

A: We recommend a 20% downpayment on your first home purchase, plus an additional 5% of funds in reserve. Can I access your bank account to design your savings plan?

G: Sure go ahead. 

A: You have 50,000 dollars in your savings account, which is 40% of the proposed mortgage. Your savings has been growing at 4,000 dollars per month. If you continue at this rate, we will have saved enough for your downpayment in 19 months. 

G: Let's plan for 4,000 a month. 

A: Plan saved. You can ask me about your saving progress at any time, and we can update your plan if circumstances change. Let's move onto your mortgage terms. With your credit score of 750 and current market rates, I expect you will pay five percent interest.

G: What would my monthly payment be?

A: Your mortgage would be 403 dollars per month and you would pay a total of 70080 dollars in interest.

G: What about a fifteen year term?

A: Your mortgage would be 593 dollars per month and you would pay a total of 31740 dollars in interest over 15 years.

G: can I talk to a financial advisor to learn more?

A: Our human advisors don't work on the weekend, but we will call you on Monday. Nationwide is on your side.
